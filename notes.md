## Before Starting

### Motivation

#### Python vs Go

I could be done quickly if I chose Python. It's a nested dict. I want to learn something new from this experience.

#### Primary Goals

1. I want to learn how to load YAML with Go. I do JSON all the time; YAML should be, in theory, identical.
2. I'm curious how initializing will work during unmarshaling. I like to build tree nodes with a depth member for convenience. As I start, I don't know if that's possible or not. I'm very curious to learn.

### Repo Contents

I populated the repo with copypasta from my other work. It's common for me to start like this; I prefer working from skeletons when possible.
